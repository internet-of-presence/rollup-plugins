## @rollup/plugin\* Rollup Plugins (unoffical fork)

This repository houses plugins that we considers critical to every day use which the organization has adopted maintenance of, and plugins that the project recommends to its users.

This fork is created because the main repo is badly broken and maintainance overhead explodes changes are not do able any more.
Biggest Improvements are that this works with current NodeJS and Current Browsers as also Current TypeScript versions. Also this forks are trying to work on Other Modern Environments
like GraalJS, Deno and so on.

- [ ] supports corepack
- [ ] supports directly importing dependencies as esm from github install.
- [ ] supports no build needed test runs
- [ ] supports smaller code base and less code for packages.
- [ ] JSDOC Typedefintions included. (Typescript Compatible)
- [ ] Additional Auto generated Typescript declarations
- [ ] Less dependencies and Maintainance overhead as also faster updates…

## Contributing

This repository is a [monorepo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monorepo) which leverages [pnpm](https://pnpm.js.org/) for dependency management.

To begin, please install `pnpm`:

```console
$ npm install pnpm -g
```

### Working with Plugin Packages

All plugin packages are kept in the `/packages` directory.

#### Adding dependencies:

```console
$ pnpm add <package> --filter ./packages/<name>
```

Where `<package>` is the name of the NPM package you wish to add for a plugin package, and `<name>` is the proper name of the plugin. e.g. `@rollup/plugin-beep`.

#### Publishing:

```console
$ pnpm publish -- <name> [flags]
```

Where `<name>` is the portion of the plugin package name following `@rollup/plugin-`. (e.g. `beep`)

The publish script performs the following actions:

- Gathers commits from the last release tag
- Determines the next appropriate version bump (major, minor, or patch)
- Updates `package.json`
- Generates a new ChangeLog entry
- Updates `CHANGELOG.md` for the target plugin
- Commits `package.json` and `CHANGELOG.md`, with a commit message is in the form `chore(release): <name>-v<version>`
- Publishes to NPM
- Tags the release in the form `<name>-v<version>` (e.g. `beep-v0.1.0`)
- Pushes the commit and tag to Github

##### Flags

The following flags are available to modify the publish process:

- `--dry` tells the script to perform a dry-run, skipping any file modifications, NPM, or Git Actions. Results from version determination and new ChangeLog additions are displayed.
- `--major`, `--minor`, `--patch` can be used to force a particular type of semver bump.
- `--no-push` will instruct the script not to push changes and tags to Git.
- `--no-tag` will instruct the script not to tag the release.

#### Running Tests:

To run tests on all packages which have changes:

```console
$ pnpm test
```

To run tests on a specific package:

```console
$ pnpm test --filter ./packages/<name>
```

Linting:

To lint all packages which have changes:

```console
$ pnpm lint
```

To lint a specific package:

```console
$ pnpm lint --filter ./packages/<name>
```

_Note: Scripts in the repository will run the root `test` and `lint` script on those packages which have changes. This is also how the CI pipelines function. To run either on a package outside of that pipeline, use `pnpm <script> -- @rollup/plugin-<name>`._

## Adding Plugins
