All files in this repository are Apache 2.0 when they are edited by us
for all files Edited by Frank Lemanschik https://github.com/frank-dspeed
are also under his private BSL https://github.com/frank-dspeed/licenses

every file has his creation and change date Applyed to it if some one
makes changes that cause a major release the file automaticly gets transfered
from BSL to Apache-2.0 even if the original change date would be in the future
We update the change date on such a release to the date of the release to reflect
that.

also we got the commit type licenses(packages/name, licenses/LICENSE) to identify license changes
in the commit history.

Untouched files retain the original license most time MIT or Apache-2.0 as also GPL
